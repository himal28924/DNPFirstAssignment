        "Description": "Blazor can run your client-side C# code directly in the browser, using WebAssembly. Because it\u0027s real .NET running on WebAssembly, you can re-use code and libraries from server-side parts of your application.\n\nAlternatively, Blazor can run your client logic on the server. Client UI events are sent back to the server using SignalR - a real-time messaging framework. Once execution completes, the required UI changes are sent to the client and merged into the DOM.Tooltip: The document object model(DOM) is a programming interface that represents all elements on an HTML page as nodes in a tree structure. Using the DOM, elements can be updated, added, and removed from the page.",

Transpilation to JavaScript is a common approach to enabling languages to run in the browser, but often provides limited functionality. Blazor works in all modern web browsers, including mobile browsers.\n\nCode running in the browser executes in the same security sandbox as JavaScript frameworks. Blazor code executing on the server has the flexibility to do anything you would normally do on the server, such as connecting directly to a database.",

        "Title": "Software design pattern",
        "Description": "In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. Rather, it is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.\n\nObject-oriented design patterns typically show relationships and interactions between classes or objects, without specifying the final application classes or objects that are involved. Patterns that imply mutable state may be unsuited for functional programming languages. Some patterns can be rendered unnecessary in languages that have built-in support for solving the problem they are trying to solve, and object-oriented patterns are not necessarily suitable for non-object-oriented languages.\n\nDesign patterns may be viewed as a structured approach to computer programming intermediate between the levels of a programming paradigm and a concrete algorithm.",
